## Foam First Impressions

- links need types; i.e., predicate types or relationship types. maybe you could model with link attributes. 
- graph viz is ok; potential at leastâ€¦ if you can filter it by relationship types
- vs code links should have different colors for different types of [[wiki-links]] links
- at least you don't have to worry about [[capitalization]] or underscores or spaces or camelCasing
- PI: docs not created by me are a different color
